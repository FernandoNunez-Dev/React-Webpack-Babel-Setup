<h2 align="center">Recommended Tools</h2>




   The following tools are recommended for a React-Webpack-Babel project. Also you will find included below
   some links for building some complex UI animations and conversion of SVG image into Data URL with the help of Webpack        loader.
   

- [ESLint-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/eslint-loader/), When using with transpiling loaders (like   babel-loader),   make sure they are in correct order(bottom to top). Otherwise files will be checked after  being processed by babel-         loader.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/building-a-complex-ui-animation-in-react-simply/), For building complex  UI animations   in React.
- [Webpack CSS-loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/) interprets @import and url() like import/ require() and   will resolve them.
- [SVG-React-Webpack](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/-how-to-load-svg-with-react-and-webpack) To utilize  an SVG image     in your React project, it will have to be transformed into a Data URL. We will need an  appropriate webpack loader in our   bundler.
